Dr. Seuss: American Icon,"Philip Nel takes a fascinating look into the key aspects of Seuss's career - his poetry, politics, art, marketing, and place in the popular imagination."" ""Nel argues convincingly that Dr. Seuss is one of the most influential poets in America. His nonsense verse, like that of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, has changed language itself, giving us new words like ""nerd."" And Seuss's famously loopy artistic style - what Nel terms an ""energetic cartoon surrealism"" - has been equally important, inspiring artists like filmmaker Tim Burton and illustrator Lane Smith. --from back cover",['Philip Nel'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,A&C Black,2005-01-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=IjvHQsCn_pgC&dq=Dr.+Seuss:+American+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data). The emphasis is on the conversion of analog waveforms into efficient digital representations and on the compression of digital information into the fewest possible bits. Both operations should yield the highest possible reconstruction fidelity subject to constraints on the bit rate and implementation complexity.","['Allen Gersho', 'Robert M.

Portraits of the Presidents: The National Portrait Gallery,"A striking collection of presidential portraits from the National Portrait Gallery, this volume encapsulates the spirit of the most powerful office in the world. America's Presidents showcases the nation's largest collection of portraits of all the presidents beyond the White House's own, capturing the permanent exhibition that lies at the heart of the Portrait Gallery's mission to tell the American story through the individuals who have shaped it. The book explores presidential imagery through portraits ranging from the traditional, such as the iconic and newly restored ""Lansdowne"" portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, to the contemporary, such as Elaine de Kooning's colorful depiction of John F. Kennedy. Many of the featured portraits reveal much about the sitter, such as the intimate rendering of an informal George W. Bush by Robert Anderson and the fanciful, mosaic-like Chuck Close image of Bill Clinton. Some tell us more about the artist, such as the likeness of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that Douglas Chandor planned to include in a larger work about peace that would commemorate Roosevelt's Yalta meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Works in other media, including sculptures and daguerreotypes, round out the presidential collection. Lively narratives accompany each piece, exploring the president's background and biography as well as the work's artistic and historical significance. Taken together, the portraits are a powerful visual exploration of the history of the highest office in the land and the diverse men who have held it.",['National Portrait Gallery'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Smithsonian Institution,2018-02-13,http://books.google.nl/books?id=lRVHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Portraits+of+the+Presidents:+The+National+Portrait+Gallery&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
Voices from the Farm: Adventures in Community Living,"Twenty-five years ago, at the height of the counter-culture movement, several hundred hippies drove their school buses into southern Tennessee and founded America's largest, modern-day intentional community, The Farm. In its heyday, the community was home to over 1,200 optimistic young people and the young-at-heart. Their purpose for coming together was to experiment with alternative lifestyles that could help raise the standard of living for impoverished people around the world while conserving the planet's resources. The results of these experiments were not always predictable, but were always interesting, and created lasting bonds among community members that are still strong today. The Farm remains a vibrant, working environment for change. Why has it lasted so long?

The Battleship Bismarck,"The Bismarck is perhaps the most famous – and notorious – warship ever built. Completed in 1941, the 45,000-ton German battleship sank HMS Hood, the pride of the British Navy, during one of the most sensational encounters in naval history. Following the sinking, Bismarck was chased around the North Atlantic by many units of the Royal Navy. She was finally dispatched with gunfire and torpedoes on 27 May, less than five months after her completion. Her wreck still lies where she sank, 4,800m down and 960km off the west coast of France. Drawing on new research and technology, this edition is the most comprehensive examination of Bismarck ever published. It includes a complete set of detailed line drawings with fully descriptive keys and full-colour 3D artwork, supported by technical details, photographs and text on the building of the ship and a record of the ship's service history.",['Stefan Draminski'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Battleship+Bismarck&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-09-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nxttDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],1.0

Scholars should not ignore these ""dark sides"" of politics, however unpleasant they may be, since they influence the world in a multitude of harmful ways. The first volume in this two-volume collection focuses on the history of underground neo-fascist networks in the post-World War II era; neo-fascist paramilitary and terrorist groups operating in Europe and Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s; and the manipulation of those and other terrorist organizations by the security forces of various states, both authoritarian and democratic. A range of global case studies are included, all of which focus on the lesser known activities of certain secular extremist milieus.

The Ground and Grammar of Theology,"The futures seems to be full of promise and excitement. Certainly at no time for nearly a millenium and a half has the opportunity for genuine theology been greater, since the ground has been cleared in the remarkable way of the old dualist and atomistic modes of thought that have plagued theology for centuries. It is, therefore, up to us as theologians to develop theology on its own proper ground in this scientific context, if only because this is the kind of life and culture, and the kind of theology that can support the message of the Gospel to mankind, as, in touch with the advances of natural science, theology comes closer and closer to a real understanding of the creation as it came from the hand of God.",['Thomas F.

Josef Fuchs on Natural Law (Moral Traditions series),"Appointed by Pope John XXIII to the Pontifical Commission on Population, Family, and Birth, Fuchs ultimately found himself disappointed in his three years of service and spent the next thirty years exploring a broad array of issues pivotal to a reconstruction of Roman Catholic natural law theory. This is the first full-length analysis of Fuchs's efforts. Beginning historically by looking at Fuchs's writings and beliefs before the Pontifical Commission appointment, including his defense of natural law during the ""situation ethics"" debates of the 50s and 60s, the concept of personal salvation, and the status of ""nature"" and ""human nature,"" Graham moves to the intellectual conversion that inspired Fuchs to reconsider his concepts following the commission appointment. From there, Graham engages in a sustained critique of Fuchs's natural theory, addressing both the strengths and weaknesses to be found there and suggest possible avenues of development that would make a positive contribution to the ongoing quest to rehabilitate the Roman Catholic natural law theory that continues to dominate the landscape of moral theology today.",['Mark Graham'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Josef+Fuchs+on+Natural+Law+(Moral+Traditions+series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Georgetown University Press,2002-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t1KlgtaPokMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

THE SECULAR CITY -SECULARIZATION AND URBANIZATION IN THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,"The study of Augustine's political teachings has suffered from a history of misreadings, both ancient and modern. It is only in recent years that the traditional lines of 'Augustinian pessimism' have been opened to question. Scholars have begun to explore the broader lines of Augustine's political thought in his letters and sermons, and thus have been able to place his classic text, The City of God, in its proper context. The essays in this volume take stock of these recent developments and revisit old assumptions about the significance of Augustine of Hippo for political thought. They do so from many different perspectives, examining the anthropological and theological underpinnings of Augustine's thought, his critique of politics, his development of his own political thought, and some of the later manifestations or uses of his thought in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and today. This new vision is at once more bracing, more hopeful, and more diverse than earlier readings could have allowed.","['John Doody', 'Kim Paffenroth', 'Kevin L.

Cinema and Soviet Society; From the Revolution To the Death of Stalin.,"The story of Soviet film over the period covered by Peter Kenez is central to the history of World Cinema. In this revised, updated paperback edition of his classic text, Peter Kenez explores the roots of Soviet cinema in the film heritage of pre-Revolutionary Russia, tracing the changes in content, style, technical means and production capacities generated by the Revolution of 1917; the constraints on form and subject imposed from the 1930s in the name of Socialist Realism; the relative freedom of expression accorded to film-makers during World War Two; and the extraordinary repression during the final years of Stalin era. Based on original research both in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the primary sources of Eastern Europe, this is the essential student text on the period which produced the major films of such 'greats' as Eisenstein, Vertov, Kuleshov, Pudovkin and many more.",['Peter Kenez'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t2U2zAEACAAJ&dq=Cinema+and+Soviet+Society%3B+From+the+Revolution+To+the+Death+of+Stalin.&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,I.B.

"God was in this place & I, i did not know: Finding self, spirituality, and ultimate meaning","God encourages us in his Word to give thanks in all things at all times. That’s not a mistake. When we choose to focus on things we are grateful for, we become happier people. Our satisfaction in life increases. Comparisons cease. Unnecessary pursuits pause. And we begin to notice the little things. The things that matter. Life. Breath. Connection. Kindness. Beauty. This is where we find God—our true happy place. As you reflect on these devotional entries, Scriptures, and prayers, refocus your perspective and begin to meditate on things that produce life and joy, that bring peace and comfort. Spend the beginning and end of your day with God, experiencing his goodness and being refreshed in his presence. Be encouraged as you take time to ponder how wonderfully unique and abundantly blessed you are. Evaluate each day in the light of God’s truth.

Cruel and Unusual (G K Hall Large Print Book Series (Cloth)),"Wanneer er in dit achtste deel in de Kay Scarpetta-serie tien lijken worden gevonden in Amerika en Engeland, lijkt er één dader te zijn. Maar hoe kan de moordenaar op twee plekken tegelijk zijn? Onnatuurlijke dood is het achtste boek uit de bloedstollende bestsellerserie rond patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta van auteur Patricia Cornwell. Deze serie, bestaande uit meer dan 20 bloedstollende crimethrillers, betekende Patricia Cornwells doorbraak als grondlegger van de pathologisch-anatomische thriller. Negen gruwelijk verminkte lijken zijn er al gevonden: vijf in Ierland en vier in Amerika. Steeds wordt het lichaam gedumpt op een vuilnisbelt en steeds worden de ledematen afgesneden. Wie pleegt deze verschrikkelijke moorden? Wanneer een tiende lijk wordt gevonden, wordt patholoog-anatoom Kay Scarpetta opgeroepen om de zaak te onderzoeken. Alles lijkt erop dat een en dezelfde dader aan het werk is, maar is er echt sprake van dezelfde dader? Kay Scarpetta en rechercheur Pete Marino ontdekken steeds meer bewijsmateriaal dat wijst op een alomvattend complot, waardoor het gehele land in gevaar is... Patricia Cornwells werk over de vrouwelijke patholoog-anatoom Scarpetta is de bestverkochte thrillerserie ter wereld; alleen in Nederland en Vlaanderen zijn er al 1,5 miljoen exemplaren verkocht.

From Potter's Field,"The sixth book in the Kay Scarpetta series, from No. 1 bestselling author Patricia Cornwell. 'America's most chilling writer of crime fiction' The Times Christmas had never been a particularly good time for Dr Kay Scarpetta. Although a holiday for most, it always seem to heighten the alienation felt by society's violent fringe; and that usually means more work for Scarpetta, Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner. The body was naked, female and found propped against a fountain in a bleak area of New York's Central Park. Her apparent manner of death points to a modus operandi that is chillingly familiar: the gunshot wound to the head, the sections of skin excised from the body, the displayed corpse - all suggest that Temple Brooks Gault, Scarpetta's nemesis, is back at work. Calling on all her reserves of courage and skill, and the able assistance of colleagues Marino and Wesley, Scarpetta must track this most dangerous of killers in pursuit of survival as well as justice - heading inexorably to an electrifying climax amid the dark, menacing labyrinths of the New York subway.

Lincoln reconsidered;: Essays on the Civil War era,"A “brilliant” look at America’s sixteenth president by the New York Times–bestselling, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lincoln (American Historical Review). First published in 1956 and revised and updated for the twenty-first century, Lincoln Reconsidered is a masterpiece of Civil War scholarship. In a dozen eloquent, witty, and incisive essays, the author of the definitive biography of Abraham Lincoln offers a fresh perspective on topics previously shrouded in myth and hagiography and brings the president’s tough-mindedness, strategic acumen, and political flexibility into sharp focus. From Lincoln’s patchwork education to his contradictory interpretations of the Constitution and the legacy of the Founding Fathers, David Herbert Donald reveals the legal mind behind the legend of the Great Emancipator. “Toward a Reconsideration of the Abolitionists” sheds new light on the radicalism of the antislavery movement, while “Herndon and Mary Lincoln” brilliantly characterizes the complicated relationship between two of the president’s closest companions. “Getting Right with Lincoln” and “The Folklore Lincoln” draw on the methods of cultural anthropology to produce a provocative analysis of Lincoln as symbol. No historian has done more to enhance our understanding of Lincoln’s presidency and the causes and effects of the Civil War than Donald. Lincoln Reconsidered is an entertaining and accessible introduction to his work and a must-read for every student of American history.",['David Herbert Donald'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Lincoln+reconsidered%3B:+Essays+on+the+Civil+War+era&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2016-03-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FkN_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Economics in one lesson,"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson.

Important trees of the Ryukyu Islands (Tokubetsu hokoku),"This book challenges the conventional view of Japanese society as monocultural and homogenous. Unique for its historical breadth and interdisciplinary orientation, Multicultural Japan ranges from prehistory to the present, arguing that cultural diversity has always existed in Japan. A timely and provocative discussion of identity politics regarding the question of 'Japaneseness', the book traces the origins of the Japanese, examining Japan's indigenous people and the politics of archaeology, using the latter to link Japan's ancient history with contemporary debates on identity. Also examined are Japan's historical connections with Europe and East and Southeast Asia, ideology, family, culture and past and present.","['Donald Denoon', 'Mark Hudson', 'Gavan McCormack', 'Tessa Morris-Suzuki']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&pg=PA115&dq=Important+trees+of+the+Ryukyu+Islands+(Tokubetsu+hokoku)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2001-11-20,http://books.google.nl/books?id=XUw6kiX9LQ0C&dq=Important+trees+of+the+Ryukyu+Islands+(Tokubetsu+hokoku)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

"A Prayer for the Government: Ukrainians and Jews in Revolutionary Times, 1917-1920 (Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies)","Discusses the experiment in Jewish autonomy in Ukraine that began with the February democratic revolution in Russia, showing how common interests between Ukrainians and Jews, especially intellectuals, led to political rights for Jews. However, the experiment was a disastrous failure. One of the reasons was the failure to stem extensive pogroms in Ukraine. In contrast to the traditional post-1927 view that has considered the Ukrainian government as the instigator of most of the pogroms, concludes that Petlyura was responsible, by default, for not doing enough to stop the hooligans, while Jewish political leaders bore some responsibility for failure to agree on Jewish self-defense.",['Henry Abramson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&q=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&dq=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Harvard Ukrainian,1999,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7sZtAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Prayer+for+the+Government:+Ukrainians+and+Jews+in+Revolutionary+Times,+1917-1920+(Harvard+Series+in+Ukrainian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],
Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism,"The doctrine of ""Islamic economics"" entered debates over the social role of Islam in the mid-twentieth century. Since then it has pursued the goal of restructuring economies according to perceived Islamic teachings. Beyond its most visible practical achievement--the establishment of Islamic banks meant to avoid interest--it has promoted Islamic norms of economic behavior and founded redistribution systems modeled after early Islamic fiscal practices. In this bold and timely critique, Timur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is simplistic, incoherent, and largely irrelevant to present economic challenges. Observing that few Muslims take it seriously, he also finds that its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, growth, or poverty reduction. Why, then, has Islamic economics enjoyed any appeal at all? Kuran's answer is that the real purpose of Islamic economics has not been economic improvement but cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity to resist cultural globalization. The Islamic subeconomies that have sprung up across the Islamic world are commonly viewed as manifestations of Islamic economics. In reality, Kuran demonstrates, they emerged to meet the economic aspirations of socially marginalized groups. The Islamic enterprises that form these subeconomies provide advancement opportunities to the disadvantaged. By enhancing interpersonal trust, they also facilitate intragroup transactions. These findings raise the question of whether there exist links between Islam and economic performance. Exploring these links in relation to the long-unsettled question of why the Islamic world became underdeveloped, Kuran identifies several pertinent social mechanisms, some beneficial to economic development, others harmful.",['Timur Kuran'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Islam+and+Mammon:+The+Economic+Predicaments+of+Islamism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2010-12-16,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VkIJGPNzVIIC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

Compendium of Herbal Magick,"Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine that permeates all things. Since the earliest times, people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told that explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees, and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories, such as those of a plant's energy, explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties, and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge that enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbes. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as authentic. You will meet many new herbes in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religi uses, but most of all, you will come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.",['Paul Beyerl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Phoenix Publishing (WA),1998,http://books.google.nl/books?id=wA7xHAAACAAJ&dq=Compendium+of+Herbal+Magick&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Health & Fitness'],

It critically examines how these groups form and how they have evolved, their key personnel, their strategies and tactics, principles, motivating philosophies and attitudes to violence. Specifically, the book seeks to understand whether such groups inevitably evolve from activists to militants to terrorists, as the literature suggests. Lastly, it considers the future of such groups, asking whether they will become more prominent as more people become ecologically aware and as global environmental conditions deteriorate, or whether such groups have peaked as a force for environmental change.",['Gerry Nagtzaam'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eco-Terrorism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Edward Elgar Publishing,2017-01-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_6jfDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Ecoterrorism'],

Deadville,"In the year 1833, two young brothers journey into the Wild West to seek their fortune; little do they know they’re embarking on the adventure of their lives. Expecting to stumble upon riches as they make their way westward, sixteen-year-old Dillon Griffith and his older brother Owen instead encounter hardship after hardship in the form of Indian raids, bloodthirsty villains, robbery, and kidnapping. With the help of a Shawnee trapper and scout, a runaway slave-turned–mountain man, and a beautiful American Indian warrior, the brothers battle the unexpected setbacks and obstacles that life in the West throws their way, and endeavor to find their place on the American frontier.Packed full of riveting action, gore, and vengeance, Deadville paints a thrilling—and historically pristine—picture of life in the Old West, from the physical environment to the social and economic milieus of frontier society.

Introduction To Mathematics for Life Scientists,"A few decades ago mathematics played a modest role in life sciences. Today, however, a great variety of mathematical methods is applied in biology and medicine. Practically every mathematical procedure that is useful in physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics has also found an important application in the life sciences. The past and present training of life scientists does by no means reflect this development. However, the impact ofthe fast growing number of applications of mathematical methods makes it indispensable that students in the life sciences are offered a basic training in mathematics, both on the undergraduate and the graduate level. This book is primarily designed as a textbook for an introductory course. Life scientists may also use it as a reference to find mathematical methods suitable to their research problems. Moreover, the book should be appropriate for self-teaching. It will also be a guide for teachers. Numerous references are included to assist the reader in his search for the pertinent literature.",['E.

On author Philip José Farmer’s Riverworld, humans from every era and culture have been simultaneously resurrected. Ancient Hebrews, medieval warriors, Spanish Inquisitors, and modern Americans intermingle in this strange new environment, but many still cling to old prejudices.

This volume includes the novelette “Riverworld,” along with two additional Riverworld tales and ten other short stories, all strange, clever, and profound. Farmer’s explorations of the wonderful and bizarre—from a portrayal of Jesus and Satan as cowpokes to a reimagining of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s Tarzan in the style of William Burroughs—plunge the reader into “one of the most imaginative worlds in science fiction” (Booklist).

Rodin in His Time: The Cantor Gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,"The sculpture of Auguste Rodin has become such an important part of our visual culture that it seems to have been with us always. The universal appeal of Rodin's work springs from its emotional expressiveness, its astonishingly lifelike vitality, and its passionate mirroring of the human condition. With his impressionistic technique, supported by a complete mastery of anatomical structure, Rodin overthrew the reigning academic precepts of finish and symmetry. By developing subjects beyond traditional allegories, he pointed the way to sheer abstraction in the twentieth century. This handsomely illustrated catalogue publishes for the first time in its entirety a major American collection of sculpture, the Cantor gifts to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and provides a rich context for Rodin's own work. It presents sculpture by Rodin's most important nineteenth-century forerunners--Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, François Rude, and others--as well as work by the contemporaries he admired, those with whom he competed, those he influenced, and those who moved from his orbit to develop their own styles at the dawn of the twentieth century. But the centerpiece of the book remains Rodin: forty-two works by the most influential sculptor of the modern period, all specially photographed and many shown in multiple views. -- Publisher description.","['Los Angeles County Museum of Art', 'Mary L.

Plain And Simple - A Woman's Journey To The Amish,"""I had an obsession with the Amish. Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary."" So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, ""Is there another way to lead a good life?"" Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts ""spoke directly to me,"" writes Bender. Somehow, ""they went straight to my heart."" Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. Plain and Simple vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen ""glows"" and ""no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday."" In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her ""crazy-quilt"" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive ""patches"" of her own life. Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, Plain and Simple speaks to the seeker in each of us.",['Sue Bender'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=4axy2kGahCEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Plain+And+Simple+-+A+Woman%27s+Journey+To+The+Amish&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4axy2kGahCEC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],11.0

"Thomas Paine : Collected Writings : Common Sense / The Crisis / Rights of Man / The Age of Reason / Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters (Library of America)","Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. “I know not whether any man in the world,” wrote John Adams in 1805, “has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and “common sense.” This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during “the times that try men’s souls” in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative “Forester” letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791–1792), written in response to Edmund Burke’s attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine’s detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794–1795), Paine’s most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine’s life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine’s work, and an index. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.",['Thomas Paine'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Library of America,1995-03-01,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&dq=Thomas+Paine+:+Collected+Writings+:+Common+Sense+/+The+Crisis+/+Rights+of+Man+/+The+Age+of+Reason+/+Pamphlets,+Articles,+and+Letters+(Library+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],8.0

Howard Zinn on History,"Howard Zinn began work on his first book for his friends at Seven Stories Press in 1996, a big volume collecting all his shorter writings organized by subject. The themes he chose reflected his lifelong concerns: war, history, law, class, means and ends, and race. Throughout his life Zinn had returned again and again to these subjects, continually probing and questioning yet rarely reversing his convictions or the vision that informed them. The result was The Zinn Reader. Five years later, starting with Howard Zinn on History, updated editions of sections of that mammoth tome were published in inexpensive stand-alone editions. This second edition of Howard Zinn on History brings together twenty-seven short writings on activism, electoral politics, the Holocaust, Marxism, the Iraq War, and the role of the historian, as well as portraits of Eugene Debs, John Reed, and Jack London, effectively showing how Zinn’s approach to history evolved over nearly half a century, and at the same time sharing his fundamental thinking that social movements—people getting together for peace and social justice—can change the course of history. That core belief never changed. Chosen by Zinn himself as the shorter writings on history he believed to have enduring value—originally appearing in newspapers like the Boston Globe or the New York Times; in magazines like Z, the New Left, the Progressive, or the Nation; or in his book Failure to Quit—these essays appear here as examples of the kind of passionate engagement he believed all historians, and indeed all citizens of whatever profession, need to have, standing in sharp contrast to the notion of ""objective"" or ""neutral"" history espoused by some. ""It is time that we scholars begin to earn our keep in this world,"" he writes in ""The Uses of Scholarship."" And in ""Freedom Schools,"" about his experiences teaching in Mississippi during the remarkable ""Freedom Summer"" of 1964, he adds: ""Education can, and should, be dangerous.""",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=iGBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+History&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],
Goal,"Practical Goal Programming is intended to allow academics and practitioners to be able to build effective goal programming models, to detail the current state of the art, and to lay the foundation for its future development and continued application to new and varied fields. Suitable as both a text and reference, its nine chapters first provide a brief history, fundamental definitions, and underlying philosophies, and then detail the goal programming variants and define them algebraically. Chapter 3 details the step-by-step formulation of the basic goal programming model, and Chapter 4 explores more advanced modeling issues and highlights some recently proposed extensions. Chapter 5 then details the solution methodologies of goal programming, concentrating on computerized solution by the Excel Solver and LINGO packages for each of the three main variants, and includes a discussion of the viability of the use of specialized goal programming packages. Chapter 6 discusses the linkages between Pareto Efficiency and goal programming. Chapters 3 to 6 are supported by a set of ten exercises, and an Excel spreadsheet giving the basic solution of each example is available at an accompanying website. Chapter 7 details the current state of the art in terms of the integration of goal programming with other techniques, and the text concludes with two case studies which were chosen to demonstrate the application of goal programming in practice and to illustrate the principles developed in Chapters 1 to 7.

"Pennant race,","From the author of The Long Season—considered by many to be the greatest baseball book of all time—comes another classic sports memoir by legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan, which chronicles how his team, the Cincinnati Reds, went on to win the 1961 National League pennant. With legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan’s first book, The Long Season, he not only entered the canon of great sports literature, but also redefined it when he returned two years later to write Pennant Race—his memoir of his days playing for the Cincinnati Reds and how the team went from not being taken seriously as a pennant contender to having a shot at the 1961 National League pennant. In Pennant Race, Brosnan—with his trademark wise-guy wit and plain-spoken practicality—once again offers a refreshingly candid alternative to hackneyed baseball mythologizing. Day by day, game by game, Brosnan reveals the real lives of professional ballplayers: their exhilaration and frustration, hope and despair, chronic worry over job security, playful camaraderie, world-weary cynicism, and boyish—if cautious—optimism. Although the Reds would ultimately lose the World Series to the Yankees, for Brosnan and his teammates, this was a winning season. Pennant Race vividly captures a remarkable year in the life of a ball club and the golden age of one of Major League Baseball’s most memorable eras. “Brosnan obviously knows his baseball, writes about it wittily, informally and with irony. He is a cynical, tough professional athlete and his book makes wonderful reading.”—New Yorker",['James P.

"The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska; or, The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass","The Pony Rider Boys in Alaska Or, The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass: Large Print By Frank Gee Patchin CHAPTER ITHROUGH ENCHANTING WATERS ""Captain, who are the four silent men leaning over the rail on the other side of the boat?"" asked Tad Butler. ""I have been wondering about them almost ever since we left Vancouver. They don't seem to speak to a person, and seldom to each other, though somehow they appear to be traveling in company. They act as if they were afraid someone would recognize them. I am sure they aren't bad characters."" Captain Petersen, commander of the steamer ""Corsair,"" which for some days had been plowing its way through the ever-changing northern waters, stroked his grizzled beard reflectively. ""Bad characters, eh?"" he twinkled. ""Well, no, I shouldn't say as they were. They're fair-weather lads. I'll vouch for them if necessary, and I guess I'm about the only person on board that knows who they are."" Tad waited expectantly until the skipper came to the point of the story he was telling. ""They are the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass, lad."" ""The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass?"" repeated Tad Butler. ""I don't think I ever heard that name before. Where is this pass, sir?"" The skipper shook his head. ""No one knows,"" he said. ""That is strange,"" wondered Butler. ""Does no one know where they dig for gold?"" ""No. They don't even know themselves,"" was the puzzling reply. Tad fixed the weather-beaten face of the skipper with a questioning gaze. ""I don't think I understand, sir.

Acting Across America,"This book addresses the historical, social, colonial, and administrative contexts that determine today's U.S. actor training, as well as matters of identity politics, access, and marginalization as they emerge in classrooms and rehearsal halls. It considers persistent, questioning voices about our nation’s acting training as it stands, thereby contributing to the national dialogue the diverse perspectives and proposals needed to keep American actor training dynamic and germane, both within the U.S. and abroad. Prominent academics and artists view actor training through a political, cultural or ethical lens, tackling fraught topics about power as it plays out in acting curricula and classrooms. The essays in this volume offer a survey of trends in thinking on actor training and investigate the way American theatre expresses our national identity through the globalization of arts education policy and in the politics of our curriculum decisions.","['Ellen Margolis', 'Lissa Tyler Renaud']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=Acting+Across+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2009-10-31,http://books.google.nl/books?id=x2WNAgAAQBAJ&dq=Acting+Across+America&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Drama'],

Making Books by Hand: A Step-by-Step Guide,"Before the advent of modern mass-production methods, books were bound by hand to remarkably high standards of quality. Beautiful and durable, they appealed to book lovers who appreciated not only a book's content but also the quality and craftsmanship of its binding. Unfortunately, the introduction of machine-binding methods, while making books widely available at reasonable prices, also largely curtailed the art and craft of making fine books by hand. This expert guide offers a solution. In its pages, craftspeople can learn the traditional methods of bookbinding and produce high-quality hand-bound books themselves. Thorough, detailed instructions, with over 270 helpful illustrations by the author, cover materials, tools, and equipment (including making your own); fundamental procedures and technical methods; rebinding an old book; making a slipcase, and other essentials. Also included are well-illustrated, step-by-step directions for eight binding projects: dust jacket; blank book, single signature; folio; blank book, four signatures; manuscript binding; music binding; and two more. Clearly written and easy to follow, this manual will be indispensable to those wishing to create high-quality handcrafted bindings themselves; it will also serve as a valuable reference for students and professionals in publishing and its allied trades.",['Aldren A.

Pla/Cebo,"The placebo effect is a fascinating but elusive phenomena. Although no standard definition of the placebo effect exists, it is generally understood as consisting of responses of individuals to the psychosocial context of medical treatments or clinical encounters, as distinct from specific physiological effects of medical interventions. The Placebo is the first book to compile a selection of classic and contemporary published articles on the topic. Systematic investigation of the placebo effect emerged in the 1950s in response to the development of randomized controlled clinical trials that used “inert” placebo interventions as a pivotal element of scientific evaluation of novel drugs. In recent years, scientific and scholarly investigation of the placebo effect has increased dramatically, reflecting a growing interest in the connection between mind and body with respect to health, the development of brain imaging techniques, dissatisfaction with the reductionist and technological orientation of biomedicine, and growing attention to the use of complementary and alternative medical treatments. The Placebo is organized into three sections: the nature and significance of the placebo effect, experimental studies of the placebo effect, and ethical issues of placebos in research and in clinical practice. This comprehensive sourcebook will be invaluable to investigators and scholars alike.","['Franklin G. Miller', 'Luana Colloca', 'Ted J.

"ASEAN's Diplomatic and Security Culture: Origins, Development and Prospects","Member states of ASEAN - the Association of South-East Asian Nations - have developed a distinctive approach to political and security co-operation, which builds on the principles of sovereign equality, non-intervention and non-interference, quiet diplomacy, mutual respect, and the principle of not involving ASEAN in mediating bilateral disputes among the membership. This book examines the origins of ASEAN's diplomatic and security culture and analyses how over time its key principles have been practised and contested as ASEAN states have responded to regional conflicts as well as challenges posed by the major regional powers, ASEAN's enlargement, and the Asian financial crisis. The book goes on to assess whether ASEAN's diplomatic and security culture is likely to remain salient as the political, economic and security context in which regional leaderships operate is undergoing further change.",['Jurgen Haacke'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ASEAN%27s+Diplomatic+and+Security+Culture:+Origins,+Development+and+Prospects&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Routledge,2013-05-13,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s3WwMjq6VWsC&dq=ASEAN%27s+Diplomatic+and+Security+Culture:+Origins,+Development+and+Prospects&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],
The Handsome road,"A saga of Louisiana by an author who “belongs among those Southern novelists who are trying to interpret the South and its past in critical terms” (The New York Times). Published in the late 1930s by New York Times–bestselling author Gwen Bristow, the Plantation Trilogy is an epic series of novels that bring to life the history of Louisiana—from its settlement in the late eighteenth century to the realities of slavery and poverty to the post–World War I era—via the intertwined lives of the members of three families: the Sheramys, the Larnes, and the Upjohns. Deep Summer is the story of Puritan pioneer Judith Sheramy and adventurer Philip Larne, who marry and strive to build an empire in the Louisiana wilderness during the American Revolution. The Handsome Road tells the story of plantation mistress Ann Sheramy Larne and poor seamstress Corrie May Upjohn, who forge an unlikely bond of friendship as they struggle to survive the cataclysms of the Civil War and Reconstruction. This Side of Glory presents the story of Eleanor Upjohn, a modern young woman in the early twentieth century who marries charming Kester Larne and struggles to save the debt-ridden plantation that her husband’s ancestors founded more than one hundred years ago.",['Gwen Bristow'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Handsome+road&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2015-05-12,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hvycBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],2.0
The Organic Codes: An Introduction to Semantic Biology,"The genetic code appeared on Earth with the first cells. The codes of cultural evolution arrived almost four billion years later. These are the only codes that are recognized by modern biology. In this book, however, Marcello Barbieri explains that there are many more organic codes in nature, and their appearance not only took place throughout the history of life but marked the major steps of that history. A code establishes a correspondence between two independent worlds , and the codemaker is a third party between those worlds . Therefore the cell can be thought of as a trinity of genotype, phenotype and ribotype. The ancestral ribotypes were the agents which gave rise to the first cells. The book goes on to explain how organic codes and organic memories can be used to shed new light on the problems encountered in cell signalling, epigenesis, embryonic development, and the evolution of language.",['Marcello Barbieri'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2003,http://books.google.nl/books?id=cvskkoD7rx0C&dq=The+Organic+Codes:+An+Introduction+to+Semantic+Biology&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Medical'],

While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications.

"Women Creating Lives: Identities, Resilience, And Resistance","There is no other published book in English studying the constitution of the Roman Republic as a whole. Yet the Greek historian Polybius believed that the constitution was a fundamental cause of the exponential growth of Rome's empire. He regarded the Republic as unusual in two respects: first, because it functioned so well despite being a mix of monarchy, oligarchy and democracy; secondly, because the constitution was the product of natural evolution rather than the ideals of a lawgiver.Even if historians now seek more widely for the causes of Rome's rise to power, the importance and influence of her political institutions remains. The reasons for Rome's power are both complex, on account of the mix of elements, and flexible, inasmuch as they were not founded on written statutes but on unwritten traditions reinterpreted by successive generations. Knowledge of Rome's political institutions is essential both for ancient historians and for those who study the contribution of Rome to the republican tradition of political thought from the Middle Ages to the revolutions inspired by the Enlightenment.",['Abby J Stewart'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&q=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&dq=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Westview Press,1994-06-15,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_Dq0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Women+Creating+Lives:+Identities,+Resilience,+And+Resistance&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Social Science'],
Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance,"There is no excuse for not teaching preventive, healthy coping strategies to prepare kids for their teenage years. -- Ronald R. Brill In his innovative book, Emotional Honesty & Self-Acceptance, Ronald Brill, a former university professor and health educator, argues that youth can learn how to self-manage upsetting and stressful experiences. This work explains the relationship between recognizing and dealing with emotional pain, which is essential to avoid harmful behavior toward ones self and others. Since the book was published in 2000 he continues to research and develop training programs for educators, including advising schools and student services professionals so they can more effectively help students learn and practice brain-based coping skills to reduce thigh risk emotional stress. This book contains guiding principles used in classroom programs he introduced to over 700 4th to 6th grade elementary students from 2002 to 2008. His virtual classroom website, www.copingskills4kids.net, helps schools, parents and counselors guide children in the use of healthy and safe coping skills. The book and website are designed to enable recovery from everyday emotional pain caused by loss, rejection, betrayal and humiliation. He refers to these as universal, core Emotionally Wounding Experiences. Like physical wounds, emotional ones can also be infected if left unattended or ignored. His classroom programs prove that by age of nine, students can learn these lessons to begin preparing for the turbulent teenage years. Violence prevention is an important benefit of developing emotional resilience and self-acceptance. The authors commitment to brain-based coping skills learning is now shared by tens of thousands of individuals and institutions around the world seeking new ways to help youth avoid harming others for the emotionally wounds they may otherwise have not learned to heal. The 300-page book uses analysis of school shooting incidents to advocate new strategies schools and parents can use to boost kids coping confidence needed to more easily get over inevitable emotionally painful and stressful experiences. It is written for mature teenagers and adults. This powerful tool provides evidence to those advocating coping skills education programs at home and school. This approach with todays youth can make them more responsible and self-accepting persons. It also helps them develop new capabilities to deal with the emotional challenges and changes during adolescence. Some Introductory Chapter Titles: What We Dont Know About Hurt Feelings Can Kill Us!

Sweet Dream Baby,"Sent to live in the humidity of rural Florida with his grandparents and his sixteen-year-old Aunt Delia for the summer, twelve-year-old Travis becomes absorbed in the closed ways of small-town life. Captivated by Delia, Travis watches her attempt to find a place for herself in the socially stunted, gossip-driven town. Delia's secrets go beyond what Travis can understand, but he believes that he alone can save her--a belief that not only forces him to grow up fast, but one that builds to a dangerous and disturbing climax. In trying to free Delia from her past, Travis leads her into a shocking present and a most uncertain future. In a work at once honest, chilling and compulsively addictive, author Sterling Watson has created a time and place where rock 'n' roll hums from AM radios, steam rises from a secluded riverbed and violent summer storms threaten the peace of silent nights. Watson's characters are brought vividly to life through Travis's touching, powerful and intensely personal voice. A dark and evocative coming of age tale, Sweet Dream Baby begins steeped in innocence and ends in a dramatically different place. ""I can't remember a book that sneaked up and grabbed me the way Sweet Dream Baby did. It's a real shocker by a very good writer."" --Elmore Leonard ""Sterling Watson's Sweet Dream Baby is one of the finest novels I've read in years, an incandescent blend of gothic noir, Faulknerian dreamscape and bittersweet coming-of-age story.

Enterprise Resources Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization (Resource Management),"To achieve success in today's business climate you must do more than provide high quality low cost products to customers when and how they want them. Customers and suppliers require fully integrated information - throughout the supply chain or value chain. You must integrate your organization so completely that executive decisions are implemented effortlessly. Competitive pressures often cause a reduction in prices, in spite of continually rising costs. A decrease in prices paired with increased costs quickly eliminates any profitability and threatens your company's ability to survive. This book shows you how you can reduce costs through the elimination of waste caused by poor communication and coordination throughout a company as well as between the company, its suppliers, and its customers. The author explains Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in non-technical terms, describing how an ERP system can fully integrate all functions in your manufacturing organization. He demonstrates the system's capability to increase efficiency and profitability - and to delight the customer - as well as its current deficiencies. In addition to his thorough coverage of ERP, the author introduces Total Enterprise Integration (TEI), the process of integrating all the information required to fully support a manufacturing company. TEI represents a logical extension of complete information integration throughout a manufacturing enterprise and into the supply chain. This new concept shows you how the intelligent use of work flow allows responsibility to go to the most appropriate front-line decision makers while maintaining proper budgetary and operational controls. The power of TEI is in the integration of communication across the entire manufacturing company, and out through the supply chain to customers and suppliers. Enterprise Resource Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization focuses on what a fully integrated system can do for you.

The California Heritage Cookbook,"Food - its cultivation, preparation and communal consumption - has long been considered a form of cultural heritage. A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.","['Ronda L.

Advertising and a Democratic Press,"In this provocative book, C. Edwin Baker argues that print advertising seriously distorts the flow of news by creating a powerfully corrupting incentive: the more newspapers depend financially on advertising, the more they favor the interests of advertisers over those of readers. Advertising induces newspapers to compete for a maximum audience with blandly ""objective"" information, resulting in reduced differentiation among papers and the eventual collapse of competition among dailies. Originally published in 1994. The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions.

At The Feet Of The Master,"The privilege is given to me, as an elder, to pen a word of introduction to this little book, the first written by a younger Brother, young in body verily, but not in Soul. The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master's own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master's thought clothed in His pupil's words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone's own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master's lips.

White Rock Ways,"Enjoy free will, but prepare for destiny. Welcome to Book 2 of Rae Crossmon's White Rock Series. Familiar faces. New players. Ancient conflicts. Fresh battles. One overriding sentiment: Free will is a terrible thing. But it’s better than the alternative. Jessica McConsas is in love with three men. Perhaps one is evil. Perhaps one is good. Perhaps one is just a catalyst. But it's never that easy when it comes to White Rock. While campaigning for her father, Jessica becomes involved with Piers, a reclusive and mysterious young man. She also finds an unlikely ally in an old friend, Vance Munroe Easton, who helps her discover the truth behind a dark family mystery. Last but not least, Jess struggles to forget Evan Helmsley and their night in the snowstorm, something much easier said than done. On the other side of the country, Evan learns how to be a friend, with the help of an extraordinary woman. Sondra has her own secrets, but she doesn't share them until it's too late. Her decisions offer Evan a chance to redeem himself by taking responsibility for another child—maybe doing it right this time. Evan’s sister Henri has to decide how much she believes in old legends, while her lover Byrne finds he is still capable of being surprised. When Henri finally meets the daughter she gave away, an old dream collides harshly with reality. A new family joins the fray. When Anderson Annolla conceives a young child from a vacation tryst, she becomes caught in an old war between Jackson, the father of her son, and Jarenth, his half-brother. Andy must ally with Jarenth to save Heath, while protecting a dark secret from her own past. Jack’s resentment and jealousy fuel a decision to hurt Andy with an action that has tragic consequences for all involved. Rae Crossmon's ""twisted fairy tales"" highlight an ancient Slavic legend wrapped in modern suspense stories. Each book builds toward a final conflict between ancient enemies while exploring themes such as free will vs. fate, family secrets, and the status of myth in contemporary American society.",['Rae Crossmon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT167&dq=White+Rock+Ways&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Rae Crossmon,2013-09-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0PBaCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
"Collected Poems, 1920-1954: Revised Bilingual Edition","A strong, idiomatic translation of Italy's greatest modern poet. Eugenio Montale is universally recognized as having brought the great Italian lyric tradition that began with Dante into the twentieth century with unrivaled power and brilliance. Montale is a love poet whose deeply beautiful, individual work confronts the dilemmas of modern history, philosophy, and faith with courage and subtlety; he has been widely translated into English and his work has influenced two generations of American and British poets. Jonathan Galassi's versions of Montale's major works--Ossi di seppia, Le occasioni, and La bufera e altro--are the clearest and most convincing yet, and his extensive notes discuss in depth the sources and difficulties of this dense, allusive poetry.

Comici spaventati guerrieri: Romanzo (I Narratori/Feltrinelli) (Italian Edition),"‘Levi is een humanist, die in staat was gebleken onder de allerergste omstandigheden zijn waardigheid te behouden.’ NRC Handelsblad De Joods-Italiaanse verzetsstrijder Primo Levi trok in 1943 de bergen in, maar hij werd al na enkele maanden gepakt en naar Auschwitz gedeporteerd. Als een van de weinigen overleefde hij die hel en keerde hij terug en schreef, aanvankelijk uit een chaotische, blinde drang, Is dit een mens. In dit boek beschrijft hij in heldere taal en nuchter het leven in het kamp, de angst, de honger, de pijn, de ontberingen, de verschrikkingen. Het wordt terecht als een van de klassieke getuigenissen over de Jodenvervolging beschouwd. In de pers ‘Wat Primo Levi kon, was de afgrijselijkste en grootste misdaad in de moderne geschiedenis, de Holocaust, van binnenuit zo beschrijven, dat hij recht doet aan de complexiteit ervan.

The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft,"'a brilliant history' The Sunday Times 'makes for riveting reading' The Independent Modern pagan witchcraft is arguably the only fully-formed religion England has given the world, and has now spread across four continents. This second edition of The Triumph of the Moon extensively revises the first full-scale scholarly study of modern pagan witchcraft. Ronald Hutton examines the nature and development of this religion, and offers a history of attitudes to witchcraft, paganism and magic in British society since 1800. Its pages reveal village cunning folk, Victorian ritual magicians, classicists and archaeologists, leaders of woodcraft and scouting movements, Freemasons, and members of rural secret societies. We also find some of the leading figures of English literature, from the Romantic poets to W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and Robert Graves, as well as the main personalities who have represented pagan witchcraft to the public world since 1950. Thriller writers like Dennis Wheatley, and films and television programmes, get similar coverage, as does tabloid journalism. The material is by its nature often sensational, and care is taken throughout to distinguish fact from fantasy, in a manner not previously applied to most of the stories involved. Meticulously researched, The Triumph of the Moon presents an authoritative insight into an aspect of modern cultural history which has attracted sensational publicity but has hitherto been little understood. This edition incorporates new research carried out by the author as well as research by others who have been inspired by this book over the twenty years since its first publication.",['Ronald Hutton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Triumph+of+the+Moon:+A+History+of+Modern+Pagan+Witchcraft&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2019-10-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=25OzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",6.0

Steam: The Untold Story Of America's First Great Invention,"In 1807, Robert Fulton, using an English mail-order steam engine, chugged four miles an hour up the Hudson River, passing into popular folklore as the inventor of the steamboat. However, the true first passenger steamboat in America, and the world, was built from scratch, and plied the Delaware River in 1790, almost two decades earlier. Its inventor, John Fitch, never attained Fulton's riches, and was rewarded with ridicule and poverty. Considering there was not a single working steam engine in America in the early 1780s, Fitch's steamboat's development was nothing short of remarkable. But he faced competition from the start, and he and several other inventors fought a string of bitter battles, legal and otherwise. Steam tells the dramatic story of Fitch and his adversaries, weaving their lives into a fascinating tale including the likes of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin. It is the story behind America's first important venture in technology, the persevering and colorful men that made it happen, and the great invention that moved a new nation westward.",['Andrea Sutcliffe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Steam:+The+Untold+Story+Of+America%27s+First+Great+Invention&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2015-03-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hJ4BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['History'],

"Labor's untold story,","""Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers."" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.","['Richard Boyer', 'Richard Owen Boyer', 'Herbert Montfort Morais']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&q=Labor%27s+untold+story,&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",United Electrical Radio &,1975,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Business & Economics'],2.0

Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors,"I am grateful beyond words for the example of the lanterns shared in this memoir whose lives I hope will illuminate my children's, your children's, and the paths of countless others coming behind.--Marian Wright Edelman, from the Preface Marian Wright Edelman, ""the most influential children's advocate in the country"" (The Washington Post), shares stories from her life at the center of this century's most dramatic civil rights struggles. She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others. She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr. Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: ""The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone."" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty.

Mothman Prophecies,"This true account of the aliens who invaded the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia - first published in 1975 - has been made into a major motion picture starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Alan Bates. For thirteen months Point Pleasant was plagued by a dark terror that culminated in a major disaster. Unearthly noises and ghostly lights in the sky gave way to mutilated animals, winged monsters, weird flying machines and worst of all, the fearsomely demonic 'Bird' - the Mothman.

"The Devil in Silicon Valley: Northern California, Race, and Mexican Americans","This sweeping history explores the growing Latino presence in the United States over the past two hundred years. It also debunks common myths about Silicon Valley, one of the world's most influential but least-understood places. Far more than any label of the moment, the devil of racism has long been Silicon Valley's defining force, and Stephen Pitti argues that ethnic Mexicans--rather than computer programmers--should take center stage in any contemporary discussion of the ""new West."" Pitti weaves together the experiences of disparate residents--early Spanish-Mexican settlers, Gold Rush miners, farmworkers transplanted from Texas, Chicano movement activists, and late-twentieth-century musicians--to offer a broad reevaluation of the American West. Based on dozens of oral histories as well as unprecedented archival research, The Devil in Silicon Valley shows how San José, Santa Clara, and other northern California locales played a critical role in the ongoing development of Latino politics. This is a transnational history. In addition to considering the past efforts of immigrant and U.S.-born miners, fruit cannery workers, and janitors at high-tech firms--many of whom retained strong ties to Mexico--Pitti describes the work of such well-known Valley residents as César Chavez. He also chronicles the violent opposition ethnic Mexicans have faced in Santa Clara Valley. In the process, he reinterprets not only California history but the Latino political tradition and the story of American labor. This book follows California race relations from the Franciscan missions to the Gold Rush, from the New Almaden mine standoff to the Apple janitorial strike. As the first sustained account of Northern California's Mexican American history, it challenges conventional thinking and tells a fascinating story. Bringing the past to bear on the present, The Devil in Silicon Valley is counter-history at its best.",['Stephen J.

The Gods of Mars,"The Barsoom series continues: John Carter returns to Mars to face a deadly race of alien gods in this classic space adventure. When Civil War veteran John Carter was mysteriously transported to Mars—known by its inhabitants as Barsoom—he found love with Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and a home closer to his heart than any he knew on Earth. After being sent unwillingly back to his native planet, Carter is finally making his return to Barsoom. But instead of arriving at the land of Helium, he finds himself a world away from his Martian love—in the Valley of Dor. Controlled by the Therns, an alien race of self-proclaimed gods, the Valley of Dor is a dangerous realm from which no one has ever returned. There, Carter reunites with his Martian friend Tars Tarkas, and together they mount a daring escape. But when Carter finally makes it to Helium, he will discover his adventure has only just begun, as Dejah has ventured into the Valley of Dor to find him . . .",['Edgar Rice Burroughs'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Gods+of+Mars&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2020-03-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9PVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],26.0

"Compact Heat Exchangers: Selection, Design and Operation","This book presents the ideas and industrial concepts in compact heat exchanger technology that have been developed in the last 10 years or so. Historically, the development and application of compact heat exchangers and their surfaces has taken place in a piecemeal fashion in a number of rather unrelated areas, principally those of the automotive and prime mover, aerospace, cryogenic and refrigeration sectors. Much detailed technology, familiar in one sector, progressed only slowly over the boundary into another sector. This compartmentalisation was a feature both of the user industries themselves, and also of the supplier, or manufacturing industries. These barriers are now breaking down, with valuable cross-fertilisation taking place. One of the industrial sectors that is waking up to the challenges of compact heat exchangers is that broadly defined as the process sector. If there is a bias in the book, it is towards this sector. Here, in many cases, the technical challenges are severe, since high pressures and temperatures are often involved, and working fluids can be corrosive, reactive or toxic. The opportunities, however, are correspondingly high, since compacts can offer a combination of lower capital or installed cost, lower temperature differences (and hence running costs), and lower inventory. In some cases they give the opportunity for a radical re-think of the process design, by the introduction of process intensification (PI) concepts such as combining process elements in one unit. An example of this is reaction and heat exchange, which offers, among other advantages, significantly lower by-product production. To stimulate future research, the author includes coverage of hitherto neglected approaches, such as that of the Second Law (of Thermodynamics), pioneered by Bejan and co- workers. The justification for this is that there is increasing interest in life-cycle and sustainable approaches to industrial activity as a whole, often involving exergy (Second Law) analysis. Heat exchangers, being fundamental components of energy and process systems, are both savers and spenders of exergy, according to interpretation.",['John E.

Beauty & Submission,"""This book is as seductive as the phenomenon that it explores. With courage, love, and joy, Frueh crosses into unexplored terrains of beauty and pleasure, where she finds a grotesquely captivating creature: Monster/Beauty. By illuminating her journey with thoughtful insight and engaging prose, she encourages readers to join her in her quest to articulate fresh ways of thinking about the aesthetic and the erotic and of theorizing the flux of lived experience."" —John Alan Farmer, senior editor of Art Journal ""Monster/Beauty is a daringly provocative experiment in personal and erotic writing and an important book for anyone interested in breaking normative codes of beauty, pedagogy, and authorial methodology. In a richly self-revealing text, Frueh proposes nothing less than a Rabellaisian re-ordering of aesthetic embodiments within social relations."" —Mira Schor, author of Wet: On Painting, Feminism, and Art Culture ""Giving new meaning to ""embodied writing,"" this book goes farther than any other toward getting the body into the text. Joanna Frueh is a performance artist first-she is also an art historian, a singer, a poet, a bodybuilder, a professor, an academic celebrity of modest fame, but her performances collapse these distinctions. Frueh's intensely personal, intensely physical prose brings an aura of presence to the book that rivals the effect she achieves on stage."" —Robyn Warhol, co-editor of Feminisms ""This book is monstrous--full of gorgeous hypermuscular women, step-mothers, and vampires; full of ravishing muscular sex, classroom erotics, splendid aging. It is a performance in which Frueh explores and celebrates her body, its powers and beauties, and those of her friends and lovers."" —Alphonso Lingis, author of Excesses, Abuses, and Dangerous Emotions ""A welcome voice in contemporary feminist theory, Frueh's Monster/Beauty reminds us of the pleasures of thinking, teaching and creating in wholly embodied, sensual and passionate acts.

Man Who Planted Trees,"‘A book for children from 8 to 80. I love the humanity of this story and how one man’s efforts can change the future for so many. It’s a real message of hope.’ Michael Morpurgo Discover this beloved masterpiece of nature writing that is a hymn to creation and to the power of the individual to do their bit to change the world for the better. In 1910, while hiking through the wild lavender in a wind-swept, desolate valley in Provence, a man comes across a shepherd called Elzéard Bouffier. Staying with him, he watches Elzéard sorting and then planting hundreds of acorns as he walks through the wilderness. Ten years later, after surviving the First World War, he visits the shepherd again and sees the young forest he has created spreading slowly over the valley. Elzéard’s solitary, silent work continues and the narrator returns year after year to see the miracle he is gradually creating: a verdant, green landscape that is a testament to one man’s creative instinct. A beautiful story of hope, survival and selflessness, The Man Who Planted Trees resonates as strongly with readers today as when it was first published.",['Jean Giono'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Man+Who+Planted+Trees&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2015-01-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xHwyBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],8.0
Howard Zinn on War,"This second edition of Howard Zinn on War is a collection of twenty-six short writings chosen by the author to represent his thinking on a subject that concerned and fascinated him throughout his career. He reflects on the wars against Iraq, the war in Kosovo, the Vietnam War, World War II, and on the meaning of war generally in a world of nations that can't seem to stop destroying each other. These readings appeared first in magazines and newspapers including the Progressive and the Boston Globe, as well as in Zinn's books, Failure to Quit, Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal, The Politics of History, and Declarations of Independence. Here we see Zinn's perspective as a World War II veteran and peace activist who lived through the most devastating wars of the twentieth century and questioned every one of them with his combination of integrity and historical acumen. In his essay, ""Just and Unjust War,"" Zinn challenges us to fight for justice ""with struggle, but without war."" He writes in ""After the War"" (2006) that while governments bring us into war, ""their power is dependent on the obedience of the citizenry. When that is withdrawn, governments are helpless."" In Howard Zinn on War, his message is clear: ""The abolition of war has become not only desirable but absolutely necessary if the planet is to be saved. It is an idea whose time has come.""",['Howard Zinn'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+War&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2011-06-14,http://books.google.nl/books?id=jmBOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Howard+Zinn+on+War&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Just Business: New Introductory Essays in Business Ethics,"faces the urgent problem of determining what political and social conditions must be preserved in order to ensure a continu. ing thriving economy. ""2 And the ethicist, we may add, can draw on all of those problems and quite a few more characteristic of situations when traditional communities struggle with the impact of sudden and unprecedented wealth as well as with a technological transformation of their society of singular proportions. Hong Kong is truly a society in transition, a society whose time is running short and which therefore cannot afford to wait long before it has to make decisive choices, choices also in ethics. The time factor which is so infamous in various ethical dilemmas applies here to the society as a whole; it may also account for some of its not just morally significant shortcomings. II. Ethics in a Cross-cultural Perspective The authors of this volume are scholars and researchers based in Hong 3 Kong who have been living and working in the territory for many years. They are not only representative of the increased research interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum of Hong Kong universities, but also of the inter disciplinary approach which has become the hallmark of work in applied eth ics. As is well documented, ethics research, at long last, has left behind its disciplinary confines and, even more so, the philosophical ivory tower and begun to permeate the full scope of the academic and scientific agenda.",['Gerhold K.
